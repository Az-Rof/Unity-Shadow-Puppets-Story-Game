# Unity Shadow Puppets Story Game

## Overview
Unity Shadow Puppets Story Game is a narrative-driven game inspired by the iconic Javanese wayang (shadow puppet) tradition, specifically the epic story of "Anoman Obong" from the Ramayana. The game brings to life the heroic journey of Anoman, the white monkey warrior, as he embarks on a sacred mission to rescue Dewi Shinta and confront the forces of the evil King Rahwana in the kingdom of Alengka.

This project is deeply rooted in Javanese culture and mythology, blending traditional storytelling with modern game design to create an immersive experience that celebrates the rich heritage of Indonesia.

## Story Background
The game is based on the "Anoman Obong" episode from the Ramayana epic as adapted in Javanese wayang kulit performances. It tells the tale of Anoman's heroic infiltration into the enemy kingdom, his trials and tribulations, and the fiery climax where he sets the kingdom ablaze as a symbol of justice and purification.
